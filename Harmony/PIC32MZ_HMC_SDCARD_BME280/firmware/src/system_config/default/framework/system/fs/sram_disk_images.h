* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The size (in number of sectors) of the desired usable data portion of the
* MSD volume
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Note: Windows 7 appears to require a minimum capacity of at least 13 sectors.
* Note2: Windows will not be able to format a drive if it is too small.  The
* reason for this, is that Windows will try to put a "heavyweight"
* (comparatively) filesystem on the drive, which will consume ~18kB of overhead
* for the filesystem.  If the total drive size is too small to fit the
* filesystem, then Windows will give an error. This also means that formatting
* the drive will "shrink" the usuable data storage area, since the default
* FAT12 filesystem implemented in the Files.c data tables is very
* lightweight, with very low overhead.
* Note3: It is important to make sure that no part of the MSD volume shares
* a flash erase page with the firmware program memory.  This can be done by
* using a custom modified linker script, or by carefully selecting the
* starting address and the total size of the MSD volume.  See also below code
* comments. Note4: It is also important to make sure that no part of the MSD
* volume shares an erase page with the erase page that contains the
* microcontroller's configuration bits (for microcontrollers that use flash
* for storing the configuration bits, see device datasheet). This can be
* accomplished by using a modified linker script, which protects the flash page
* with the configuration bits (if applicable), or, by carefully choosing the
* FILES_ADDRESS and FS_INTERNAL_FLASH_DRIVE_CAPACITY, to make sure the MSD
* volume does extend into the erase page with the configuration
* bits.
